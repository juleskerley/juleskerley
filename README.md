- Hi, I’m @juleskerley or Jules.
- I am interested generally in coding and working on tools that assist others with research, tests, and making tasks easier. I also occasionally try to build small creative-writing or Worldbuilding tools when I have the time.
- I am currently learning HPC related information along with trying to learn coding languages relevant to research, along with several coding languages (Python, C, C++, and others) and coding processes to expand what I can do right now.
- If you want to contact me about anything I've worked on.
